- Hi, Iâ€™m Michael (@Gapodo)
- I'm a sysadmin focusing on Linux, Kubernetes and VMware vSphere (getting less and less as Kubernetes takes over)
- I'm a part time student, studing computer science with a focus on digital innovation
- Currently trying to focus on DevOps and IaC
- Bash freak, currently learning Go

You want to contact me?
- Matrix (the way to go :D) @gapodo:kle.li
- Email (the good old way) gapodo at geekvoid.net

Where my Code mainly lives?
- [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/gapodo) which utilizes [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org)
- My personal [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) instance at [git.kle.li](https://git.kle.li/gapodo)

My code is becoming mostly mirrored from my [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) instance at https://git.kle.li and built by my own CI instances for [Forgejo](https://ci.kle.li) and [Github](https://github-ci.kle.li) powered by the the awsome [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) project.
