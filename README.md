- Hi, Iâ€™m Michael (@Gapodo)
- I'm a sysadmin focusing on Linux, Kubernetes and VMware vSphere (getting less and less as Kubernetes takes over)
- I'm a part time student, studing computer science with a focus on digital innovation
- Currently trying to focus on DevOps and IaC
- As a student project I'm developing a project called @trash2gather in a team of 4.
- Bash freak, currently learning Go

You want to contact me?

- Email (the good old way) gapodo at geekvoid.net

My code is becoming mostly mirrored from my [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance at https://git.kle.li and built by my own CI instances for [Gitea](https://ci.kle.li) and [Github](https://github-ci.kle.li) powered by the the awsome [Woodpecker CI](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) project.
